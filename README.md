# Brain MRI Segmentation

We study 2D and 3D brain MRI tissue segmentation using traditional computer vision techniques. This project develops and evaluates multiple segmentation approaches on T1-weighted MRI data to segment 6 tissue classes: air, skin/scalp, skull, CSF, gray matter, and white matter.

## Description

This project works with 10 consecutive axial cross-sections of a publicly available MRI of a single human subject. The data consists of:

- **T1-weighted MRI images**: 362Ã—434 pixels per slice, 10 slices at 1mm intervals (10mm total span)
- **Ground truth labels**: Pre-segmented data for comparison and evaluation
- **Tissue classes**:
  - Label 0: Air
  - Label 1: Skin/scalp  
  - Label 2: Skull
  - Label 3: CSF (Cerebrospinal Fluid)
  - Label 4: Gray Matter
  - Label 5: White Matter

## What Was Done

### 2D Segmentation Approaches

Three different 2D segmentation approaches were developed and evaluated:

**Approach 1**: Morphological Chan Vese + Otsu Thresholding + K-Means
- Uses Morphological Chan Vese (MCV) for brain extraction
- Multi-Otsu thresholding for non-brain regions (0,1,2)
- K-Means clustering for brain regions (3,4,5)

**Approach 2**: Morphological Geodesic Active Contours + Otsu Thresholding + K-Means  
- Uses Morphological Geodesic Active Contours (MGAC) for brain extraction
- Same thresholding and clustering as Approach 1

**Approach 3**: Morphological Geodesic Active Contours + Otsu Thresholding + Multi-Otsu Thresholding
- Uses MGAC for brain extraction
- Multi-Otsu thresholding for both non-brain and brain regions

### 3D Segmentation Approaches

The best performing 2D approaches were adapted for 3D processing:

**Approach 2 3D**: MGAC + Otsu + K-Means applied to entire 3D volume

**Approach 3 3D**: MGAC + Otsu + Multi-Otsu applied to entire 3D volume

### Key Implementation Details

- **Brain extraction**: Separation of brain and non-brain regions using active contour methods
- **Morphological processing**: Closing and area closing operations to refine masks
- **Region segmentation**: Multi-class segmentation using thresholding and clustering
- **3D adaptation**: Leveraging inter-slice continuity for improved segmentation

### Observation

- **MGAC vs MCV**: Morphological Geodesic Active Contours significantly improved CSF (region 3) segmentation due to better gradient exploitation
- **K-Means vs Multi-Otsu**: K-Means showed slightly better performance on Jaccard Index, while Multi-Otsu was faster
- **2D vs 3D**: 3D approaches achieved better results (0.93 vs 0.92 F1-score) by leveraging inter-slice continuity
- **Performance trade-offs**: 3D processing took ~2.3x longer but provided more robust segmentation

## Conclusions

1. **Best 2D Approach**: Approach 2 (MGAC + K-Means) provided the best balance of accuracy and reliability
2. **3D Advantage**: 3D processing significantly improved segmentation quality, especially for challenging regions
3. **Method Selection**: 
   - For **accuracy**: Approach 2 (2D,3D)
   - For **speed**: Use Multi-Otsu thresholding (2D,3D)
   - For **robustness**: Apply 3D processing when inter-slice alignment is good
4. **Practical Considerations**: 3D approaches are more computationally expensive but provide better results for clinical applications
